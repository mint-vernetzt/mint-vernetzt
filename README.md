## How to

### Set up Node.js

1. Install nvm ([Guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating))
2. Run `nvm use` in repository root

*Hint:*

If you can read something like `You need to run "nvm install v16.5.0" to install it before using it.` run `nvm install v16.5.0`. ðŸ˜Ž

### Write commit messages

We are using [AngularJS's commit message convention](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits) to provide features like automatic changelog generation. To force this convention we are using the [Commitizen command line tool](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli). If you commit changes via `git commit` you'll be ask about scope, type, subject, etc. of the changes.
